This disk contains the complete source code from the book
GENETIC ALGORITHMS IN C++.

The source code was tested with Borland C++ 4.5 and
Microsoft Visual C++ v2.0; the FORGE application is
compatible with 16- and 32-bit Windows environments
(including Windows 95).

The FORGE16.EXE file is a 16-bit, Windows 3.1-compatible
program. It was compiled with Borland C++.

The FORGE32.EXE file is a 32-bit, Windows 95/NT-compatible
program. It was compiled with Visual C++.

Included on this disk are project files for the Borland
and Microsoft compilers.

An Author's Note on Distribution:

Okay, I know reality: Somebody's going to post this source
code on the networks or put it on some user group disk.
PLEASE DON'T. The reason we have copyrights is to protect an
author's ability to profit from his or her creations;
without protection for intellectual property, people such as
myself probably would not write these books.

Here's my bottom line: Feel free to distribute the compiled
applications in the APPS directory -- but keep the source
code for your own use. After all, why give away something
you paid good money for?

Feel free to use the source code in any non-commercial
application, so long as you modify the "About" box to
clearly note my original copyright and your subsequent
changes -- that way, we each get credit for our work.

If you plan to use this software as part of a commercial
application, please contact the author via M&T Books for
an appropriate license. You wouldn't want somebody stealing
your work, would you? I've got three little girls and a
wife to feed!

Thanks, and enjoy!
